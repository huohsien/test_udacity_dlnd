    "# Inference and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** set. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to do this in PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, let's start by loading the dataset through torchvision. You'll learn more about torchvision and loading data in a later part. This time we'll be taking advantage of the test set which you can get by setting `train=False` here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "testset = datasets.FashionMNIST('~/.pytorch/F_MNIST_data/', download=True, train=False, transform=transform)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set contains images just like the training set. Typically you'll see 10-20% of the original dataset held out for testing and validation with the rest being used for training."

Typically this is just accuracy, the percentage of classes the network predicted correctly. Other options are [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#Definition_(classification_context)) and top-5 error rate. We'll focus on accuracy here. First I'll do a forward pass with one batch from the test set."
